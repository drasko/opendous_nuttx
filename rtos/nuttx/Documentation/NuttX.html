      The goal is to provide implementations of most standard POSIX OS interfaces

      processors.
    </p>
      NON-GOALS: (1) It is not a goal to provide the rich level of OS
      features like those provided with Linux.
      Small footprint is more important than features.
      Standard compliance is more important than small footprint.
      (2) There is no MMU-based support for processes.
      At present, NuttX assumes a flat address space.

      NuttX strives to achieve a high degree of standards compliance.
      The primary governing standards are POSIX and ANSI standards.
      Additional standard APIs from Unix and other common RTOS's are
      adopted for functionality not available under these standards
      or for functionality that is not appropriate for the deeply-embedded
      RTOS (such as <code>fork()</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of this standards conformance, software developed under other
      standard OSs (such as Linux) should port easily to NuttX.

      The philosophy behind that NuttX is that lots of features are great... <i>BUT</i>
      also that if you don't use those features, then you should not have to pay a penalty
      for the unused features.
      And, with NuttX, you don't!  If you don't use a feature, it will not
      be included in the final executable binary.
      You only have to pay the penalty of increased footprint for the features
      that you actually use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using a variety of technologies, NuttX can scale from the very tiny to
      the moderate-size system.  I have executed NuttX with some simple applications
      in as little as 32Kb <i>total</i> memory (code and data).
      On the other hand, typical, richly featured NuttX builds require more like 64Kb
      (and if all of the features are used, this can push 100Kb).

      One may be intimidated by the size NuttX source tree.  There are hundreds of source files!

      Actually, the large number of files is one of the tricks to keep NuttX small and
      as scalable as possible.
      Most files contain only a single function. 
      Sometimes just one tiny function with only a few lines of code.

        Because in the NuttX build processed, objects are compiled and saved into
        <i>static libraries</i> (<i>archives</i>).
        Then, when the file executable is linked, only the object files that are needed
        are extracted from the archive and added to the final executable.
        By having many, many tiny source files, you can assure that no code that you do
        not execute is ever included in the link.
        And by having many, tiny source files you have better granularity --
        if you don't use that tiny function of even just a few lines of code, it will
        not be included in the binary.

    <b>Other Tricks</b>

    <p>
      As mentioned above, the use of many, tiny source files and linking from static
      libraries keeps the size of NuttX down.
      Other tricks used in NuttX include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
         <b>Configuration Files</b>.
         Before you build NuttX, you must provide a configuration file that specifies
         what features you plan to use and which features you do not.
         This configuration file contains a long list of settings that control
         what is built into NuttX and what is not.
         There are hundreds of such settings
         (see the <a href="NuttxPortingGuide.html#apndxconfigs">NuttX Porting Guide</a>
         for a partial list that excludes platform specific settings).
         These many, many configuration options allow NuttX to be highly tuned to
         meet size requirements.
         The downside to all of these configuration options is that it greatly
         complicates the maintenance of NuttX -- but that is my problem, not yours.
      </li>
      <li>
         <b>Weak Symbols</b>
         The GNU toolchain supports <i>weak</i> symbols and these also help to keep
         the size of NuttX down.
         Weak symbols prevent object files from being drawn into the link even if they
         are accessed from source code.
         Careful use of weak symbols is another trick for keep unused code out of the
         final binary.

          David also contributed I2C and SPI drivers plus several important LPC313x USB bug fixes
          that appear in the NuttX 5.6 release.

    <p><b>AVR-Specific Issues</b>.
      The basic AVR port is solid and biggest issue for using AVR is its tiny SRAM memory and its Harvard architecture.
      Because of the Harvard architecture, constant data that resides to flash is inaccessible using &quot;normal&quot; memory reads and writes (only SRAM data can be accessed &quot;normally&quot;).
      Special AVR instructions are available for accessing data in FLASH, but these have not been integrated into the normal, general purpose OS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most NuttX test applications are console-oriented with lots of strings used for printf and debug output.
      These strings are all stored in SRAM now due to these data accessing issues and even the smallest console-oriented applications can quickly fill a 4-8Kb memory.
      So, in order for the AVR port to be useful, one of two things would need to be done:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Don't use console applications that required lots of strings.
        The basic AVR port is solid and your typical deeply embedded application should work fine.
        Or,
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a special version of printf that knows how to access strings that reside in FLASH (or EEPROM).

          Current Status: I think I have a hardware problem with my serial port setup.
          There is a good chance that the NSH port is complete and functional, but I am not yet able to demonstrate that.
          At present, I get nothing coming in the serial RXD line (probably because the pins are configured wrong or I have the MAX232 connected wrong).

       <b>STATUS:</b>
         Coding is complete for the MC9S12NE64 and for the NE64 Badge board.
         However, testing has not yet begun due to issues with BDMs, Code Warrior, and
         the paging in the build process.
         Progress is slow, but I hope to see a fully verified MC9S12NE64 port in the near future.

    <p>
      This is a tougher environment.
      In this case, the Windows native toolchain is unaware of the
      Cygwin <i>sandbox</i> and, instead, operates in the native Windows environment.
      The primary difficulties with this are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Paths</b>.
        Full paths for the native toolchain must follow Windows standards.
        For example, the path <code>/home/my\ name/nuttx/include</code> my have to be
        converted to something like <code>'C:\cygwin\home\my name\nuttx\include'</code>
        to be usable by the toolchain.
      </li>
      <p>
        Fortunately, this conversion is done simply using the <code>cygpath</code> utility.
      </p>
      <li>
        <b>Symbolic Links</b>
        NuttX depends on symbolic links to install platform-specific directories in the build system.
        On Linux, true symbolic links are used.
        On Cygwin, emulated symbolic links are used.
        Unfortunately, for native Windows applications that operate outside of the
        Cygwin <i>sandbox</i>, these symbolic links cannot be used.
      </li>
      <p>
        The NuttX make system works around this limitation by copying the platform
        specific directories in place.
        These copied directories make work a little more complex, but otherwise work well.
      </p>
      <p><small>
        NOTE: In this environment, it should be possible to use the NTFS <code>mklink</code> command to create links.
        This should only require a minor modification to the build scripts (see <code>tools/winlink.sh</code> script).
      </small></p>
      <li>
        <b>Dependencies</b>
        NuttX uses the GCC compiler's <code>-M</code> option to generate make dependencies.  These
        dependencies are retained in files called <code>Make.deps</code> throughout the system.
        For compilers other than GCC, there is no support for making dependencies in this way.
        For Windows native GCC compilers, the generated dependencies are windows paths and not
        directly usable in the Cygwin make.  By default, dependencies are surpressed for these
        compilers as well.
      </li>
      <p><small>
        NOTE: dependencies are suppress by setting the make variable <code>MKDEPS</code> to point
        to the do-nothing dependency script, <code>tools/mknulldeps.sh</code>.
        Dependencies can be enabled for the Windows native GCC compilers by setting
        <code>MKDEPS</code> to point to <code>$(TOPDIR)/tools/mkdeps.sh --winpaths $(TOPDIR)</code>.
      </small></p>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Supported Windows Native Toolchains</b>.
      At present, only the Zilog Z16F, z8Encore, and eZ80Acclaim ports use a non-GCC native Windows
      toolchain(the Zilog ZDS-II toolchain).
      Support for Windows native GCC toolchains (CodeSourcery and devkitARM) is currently implemented
      for the NXP LPC214x, STMicro STR71x, and Luminary LMS6918 ARM ports.
      (but could easily be extended to any other GCC-based platform with a small effort).

         I've tried nsh profile and build process completed successfully.
         One remark is necessary: Nuttx makefiles for ez80 are referencing <code>cygpath</code> utility.
         Wine provides similar thing called <code>winepath</code> which is compatible and offers compatible syntax.
         To use that, <code>winepath</code> (which itself is a shell script) has to be copied as <code>cygpath</code> somewhere in <code>$PATH</code>, and edited as in following patch:

        &quot;Better solution would be replacing all <code>cygpath</code> references in  <code>Makefiles </code> with  <code>$(CONVPATH)</code> (or  <code>${CONVPATH}</code> in shell scripts) and setting <code>CONVPATH</code> to  <code>cygpath</code> or  <code>winepath</code> regarding to currently used environment.

      <b>Environment Dependencies</b>.
      The primary environmental dependency of NuttX are (1) GNU make,
      (2) bash scripting, and (3) Linux utilities (such as cat, sed, etc.).
      If you have other platforms that support GNU make or make
      utilities that are compatible with GNU make, then it is very
      likely that NuttX would work in that environment as well (with some
      porting effort). If GNU make is not supported, then some significant
      modification of the Make system would be required.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>GNUWin32</b>.
      For example, with suitable make system changes, it should be possible to
      use native GNU tools (such as those from
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/">GNUWin32</a>)
      to build NuttX.
      However, that environment has not been used as of this writing.
   </p>
      <p><small>
        NOTE: One of the members on the <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/nuttx/">NuttX forum</a>
        reported that they successful built NuttX using such a GNUWin32-based, Windows native environment.
        They reported that the only necessary change was to the use the NTFS mklink command to create links
        (see <code>tools/winlink.sh</code> script).

nuttx-6.10 2011-10-06 Gregory Nutt &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * lib/stdio/lib_fopen.c:  Fix an error in fopen(); the file pointer was not
      being positioned at the end of the file when the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;a+&quot; modes are
      used.  There are other issues with the &quot;a+&quot; modes (see the top-level TODO
      list).
    * drivers/usbdev/cdc_serial.c and include/nuttx/usb/cdc.h and cdc_serial.h:
      Add support for the CDC ACM serial device class.
    * fs/fat/fs_fat32.c: Fix a critical bug in the write logic:  It a tiny write
      cross a sector boundary, then two sector writes will occur.  The first part
      in the first sector may be written to the wrong sector number.
    * fs/fat/fs_fat32util.c:  Fix a stray write into the FAT (always sector 964 on
      FAT32).  This bug will cause some lost chains.  I'm sure this bug could
      corrupt files but at present, the only thing I have seen is that before
      fixing this bug, the Windows chkdsk utility would report these lost chains.
    * arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_i2c.c: Driver can now operate in a faster polled
      mode (at the expense of using more cpu cycles).
    * arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_i2c.c: Add trace debug capability.  Enabled with
      CONFIG_I2C_TRACE.
    * arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_i2c.c: Fix another bug where I2C conflicts with FSMC
      being enabled.  That time at the tail end of the transaction where there is
      an unfinished stop condition.
    * sched/mq_timedreceive.c and sched/mq_timedsend.c:  The count of threads
      waiting on the message queues was not being decremented after a timeout.
      This would cause the accounting logic to become out of sync and the, perhaps,
      an assertion to be triggered.  This is an important bug and fixes a
      potential crash when using mq_timedreceived() and mq_timedsend().
    * sched/mq_sndinternal.c: Related to the above, the send logic was incrementing
      the wrong counter when it waited as part of the mq_timedsend.c logic.
    * fs/fat:  Fix an error in the long file name logic:  If the long file name
      is an even multiple of 13 bytes in length, then it should not include a
      NULL terminating character.  Fix contributed by Kaushal Parikh.
    * configs/sim/nx11: Created a separate configuration to build the NX
      example using the a simulated framebuffer driver on an X11 window.  This
      example has been verified on Ubuntu 9.09 (it does not work on Cygwin).
    * arch/sim/src/up_touchscreen.c and up_x11eventloop.c: Adds support for a
      simulated NuttX touchscreen device using mouse/pointer feedback from an
      x11 window.
    * configs/sim/touchscreen: Adds a configuration to verify the simulated
      touchscreen driver (Does not work on Cygwin).
    * configs/sam3u/touchscreen: This is the configuration that I plan to use
      to verify the SAM3U-EK touchscreen driver.  However, as of this writing,
      there is no touchscreen driver for the board.
    * CONFIG_RTC_HIRES: Add an option to support either a high-resolution RTC
      that completely replaces the system timer tick but may overflow and lose
      time when the MCU is off and also for a low-resolution (1 sec/tick) RTC
      that can run until 2106 with no overflow.  But in this latter case, higher
      resolution time must come from the system timer.
    * CONFIG_SYSTEM_UTC: Removed support for the UTC system timer.  It just
      doesn't do enough to be worth the CPU cycles or the complexity.
    * CONFIG_SYSTEM_TIME16: Added support for an optional 64-bit system timer.
    * fs/fat/fs_fat32util.c: Add support for FAT date/time stamps; Enabled via
      CONFIG_FS_FATTIME.
    * arch/arm/src/sam3u/sam3u_spi.c: Add an SPI driver for the AT91SAM3U.
    * drivers/input/ads7843e.c and include/nuttx/input/ads7843e.h: Add a
      driver for the TI ADS7843E touchscreen controller.
    * fs/nxffs/nxffs_open.c:  Fix an error when a file is open for writing; since
      the file will get deleted it is already exists, there must be a check if
      there are other open references to the file.
    * arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_sdio.c: Fixed an error where during SDHC
      initialization interrupts were not being re-enabled.  Caused more subtle
      errors than you would think.
    * arch/arm/src/stm32/stm32_i2c.c:  Fixed an error where I2C timeouts appeared
      to be successful transfers.
    * configs/sim/nsh2: Add another simulated NSH configuration.  This one
      supports X11 graphics, C++, and exercises graphic functions as built-in
      commands.

apps-6.10 2011-10-06 Gregory Nutt &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * apps/system/i2c:  Add repitition and address auto-incrementing so that
      and command can be executed numerous times.  Add a new verify command
      that will write to a register, read from register, and verify that
      returned value.
    * apps/graphics/tiff:  Add a library that can be used to create TIFF files.
    * apps/examples/tiff:  Add a unit test for the TIFF file creation logic
    * apps/examples/lcdrw:  Add a test to verify if you can or can or read
      data from an LCD correctly.
    * apps/examples/usbterm:  A USB terminal example.. more of a USB chat or
      serial bridge:  Data received on local console echoed via USB serial; 
      data received on USB serial is echoed on the local console.
    * apps/examples/touchscreen:  Add a simple, generic test for any
      touschscreen driver.
    * Makefile:  The apps/ Makefile now checks for an apps/external directory
      or symbolic link.  If such a directory/link exists (and has a Makefile),
      it will be added to the apps/ build.  This allows external directories
      to be included into the apps/ build by simply creating a symbolic link.

pascal-1.0 2011-05-15 Gregory Nutt &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * nuttx/:  The Pascal add-on module now installs and builds under the
      apps/interpreters directory.  This means that the pascal-2.1 module is
      incompatible with will all releases of NuttX prior to nuttx-6.0 where the 
      apps/ module was introduced.

buildroot-1.10 2011-05-06 &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * Add patch submitted by Dimiter Georgiev to work around problems in building
      GDB 6.8 with versions of Cygwin &gt; 1.7.
    * configs/i486-defconfig-4.3.3 - Builds an i486 cross development toolchain
      using gcc 4.3.3.  Why wouldyou want such a thing?  On Linux, of course,
      such a thing is not needed because you can use the installed GCC to build
      i486 ELF binaries.  But that will not work under Cygwin!  The Cygwin
      toolchain (and probably MinGW), build DOS MZ format executables (i.e.,
      .exe files).  That is probably not usable for most NuttX targets.
      Instead, you should use this i486-elf-gcc to generate true ELF binaries
      under Cygwin.
    * Makefile - Alter copy arguments to avoid permissions problems when
      copying NuttX header files.
    * toolchain/nxflat/nxflat.mk and Makefile - Fix include paths.
    * toolchain/gcc/3.3.6 - Added a patch to fixed compilation error on Ubuntu
      9.10.
    * toolchain/nxflat/Makefile - Correct static library link order.
    * configs/arm920t-defconfig-4.3.3 - Enable support for NXFLAT tools.
    * toolchain/binutils/2.21 and toolchain/gcc/4.5.2 - Add support for GCC
      4.5.2 with binutils 2.21.
    * configs/arm920t-eabi-defconfig-4.5.2 - Add a configuration to build a
      GCC 4.5.2 EABI ARM toolchain for the ARM920t.
