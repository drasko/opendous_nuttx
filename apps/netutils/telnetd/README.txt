This directory is here for historical reasons. Nothing contained in this
directory is currently used by NuttX.  This directly contains a functional
port of the tiny uIP shell.  In the NuttX environment, the NuttShell (at
apps/nshlib) supercedes this tiny shell and also supports telnetd.

This example is retained here for reference purposes only.
